# Pollen-based presentation template

This is a convenient bundle of presentation capabilities built on top of Markdown parsing -> presentations provided by [Remark.js](https://remarkjs.com/#1).

Everything is organized through [Pollen](https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/)

Provides a convenient meta-language including:

1. Compile custom LaTeX inline and embed them in the presentation.
2. Compile custom GraphViz graphs and embed them in the presentation.
3. Inline and equation rendering using MathJax.

**Note**: the fonts are not free! Please see [Matthew Butterick's typography](https://mbtype.com/).
